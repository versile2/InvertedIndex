### Welcome to my app, powered by Blazor Server, MudBlazor, and .NET 8!

- The first showcase is hierarchical navigation links. I've included a SQLite DB implementation here but it would be trivial to switch to any other provider.

- The second showcase is behind the scenes in wrapping the LocalBrowserStorage included in .NET with a wrapper so I can write successful unit tests.
  - Still In Progress

- The third showcase is a random project I thought would be fun, Data Structures - Inverted Index. If you want more information [Go Here](https://github.com/karan/Projects)

    #### Data Structures - Inverted Index
    Inverted index - An [**Inverted Index**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) is a data structure used to create full text search. Given a set of text files, implement a program to create an inverted index. Also create a user interface to do a search using that inverted index which returns a list of files that contain the query term / terms. The search index can be in memory.

- The fourth showcase is Error Handling / Catching, in the event of an error I want the Error Page to be descriptive. In debug mode show the full error, in production mode log it to the database.

- Still pending are the Unit Tests
